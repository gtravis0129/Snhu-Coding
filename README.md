Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   This program reads and writes from a file and organizes the information from a text file.
What did you do particularly well?
  The fact that I was able to make this categorize alphabetically and numerically is what I am most proud of.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There are a few areas for upgrades, but one in particular is architecture and data handling.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part was getting the sorting to work both alphabetically and numerically. I overcame it by breaking the problem into steps and using references like cppreference and the debugger.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The work with arrays and the ability to manupulate them.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Encapsulating the program and having clean, organized code structure goes a long way toward that.
